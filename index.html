<h1> My career plans</h1>
<p> I don't really have a set career plan, but i'm thinking about going on the route to become a Business Analyst when i graduate highshool, while completing my cosmotology degree that im starting in a few months. I might do cyber security instead of Business Analyst but as much as I love the aspect of doing something realted to computer science I don't think I will like having my self revovle around it 24/7. Computer science is somwthing I enjoy but when im in a position where it becaomes a requirement instead of a passion, I don't think it will ever work out. I still don't know about my future plans but these are just some options im really looking into.</p>
